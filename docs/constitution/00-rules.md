# Constitution — the rules every AI on this project obeys

These rules are the single source of truth for how work is done here. `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` are short pointers to this folder — the content lives here so that **any** capable coding AI can pick this project up and continue it.

Read this file, then `01-workflow.md`, then `02-tech-stack.md`. Then read `docs/status.md` to find out where the project stands.

## Where the work happens

- **Everything is on the user's own computer.** The project is one folder. You run inside the editor on that machine, the user reads and comments on the same files in Obsidian, and the product runs locally until it is deployed. **There is no workshop server and no second copy of anything.**
- Because there is only one copy, there is nothing to synchronise and nothing to conflict. The user can edit a file and you see it immediately.
- **Their code and their idea are private.** Nothing is shared with anyone else — no shared machine, no shared account. Say this once, plainly, when it comes up; it is the reason the workshop works this way.
- The one thing you must not assume is the operating system. Most users are on Windows. Check before you guess a path, a shell or a command name.

## Git — history and backup, not synchronisation

- The project is a git repository connected to a **private** repository on the user's **own** GitHub account. Its job here is history (an undo that survives everything) and backup (the work outlives the laptop).
- **Commit after every meaningful step** — a phase finished, a document approved, a checklist item built. One short line describing what changed. **Push** with every commit; the editor is configured to do that automatically.
- **Everything happens on `main`. Never create a branch.** One person, one project.
- **Never commit a secret.** `secrets/*.local.md` and `.env` are git-ignored and must stay that way.
- If a conflict ever appears — it should not, since there is only one copy — stop, say so plainly, and ask the user what they changed elsewhere. Do not guess a side.

## Which AI does what

The user has two assistants and they are not interchangeable. Respect the split; it exists to make a limited quota last two days.

| Work | Which assistant | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Thinking — idea, PRD, data model, UX, design guidance, dependencies, scenarios, planning, reconciliation, iteration analysis, debugging | **Claude Code — Opus 5, effort high** | This is the judgement, and it is what the paid quota is for. |
| Writing the product's code (`/build`) | **Claude Code — Sonnet 5, effort medium** | The thinking is already on disk; here throughput matters and it costs far less. |
| The screens (`/design`) | **Claude on the web, Design, Opus, highest thinking** | A different tool entirely, in the browser. |
| Installing things — on the laptop (`/setup-dev`) and on the server (`/deploy`) | **GitHub Copilot (free), in the same editor** | Mechanical, no product judgement, and it costs nothing. Tell the user to switch to the Copilot panel for these, and switch back afterwards. |

- The Claude switch happens once, at the `/plan` → `/build` boundary, and the user makes it: `/clear`, then `/model`, then `/effort`. Tell them all three, in that order.
- If you can switch model yourself, do it silently. If not, tell the user the exact thing to type and wait. Do not print a model name you have not verified is available.
- **If the user hits their five-hour limit, nothing is lost.** Say so, tell them the work is committed and `docs/status.md` is current, and give them the two real options: wait for the window to reset, or ask the organiser for a spare assistant. Never restart work from the beginning after a limit.

## Standing behaviors — these apply in every phase

- **Language — ask once, at the start.** There are **two** languages, not one: the language of the **conversation** and the language of the **documents**. Offer exactly three combinations and let the user pick:
  1. Conversation فارسی · documents فارسی
  2. Conversation English · documents English
  3. **Conversation English · documents فارسی — recommend this one.** Persian reads badly in a terminal (right-to-left text breaks up), but reads perfectly in the editor where the documents are actually read. This combination gives the best of both.

  Whatever they pick applies from then on regardless of which language they type in — **never mirror their input language**. Record both values in `docs/profile.md` and `docs/decisions.md`. Only an explicit request changes either one, and each can be changed independently.
- **Files are the source of truth — chat is throwaway.** Everything substantive goes in a file: the user writes their idea, answers and comments in files; you write drafts and your questions into files. **Never ask your questions in the chat.** Chat carries only short control signals — a «انجام شد», a one-line status, a readiness call.
- **Secrets come from a file, never from the chat.** See Secrets below.
- **End every questions round with the three-way handshake.** This is the **one** permitted menu — everywhere else you decide and name a single next step. After writing a questions file, end your turn with exactly:

  ```
  ۱. پیش‌فرض‌ها خوب بود — ادامه بده
  ۲. جواب دادم / کامنت گذاشتم
  ۳. چیزِ دیگری می‌خواهم بگویم
  ```

  **On 1:** they changed nothing on purpose. Record in `docs/decisions.md` that the defaults were accepted, and continue immediately.
  **On 2:** re-read the files and work from what is actually written there. There is one copy of every file, so their text is already in front of you — never ask them to sync, push or commit before you can read it.
  **On 3:** listen, then decide the next step yourself.
- **You decide when a phase is done — the user never does.** After each round, check the state yourself: any unanswered open question? any new one your last round raised? any comment you have not addressed? Only when it is clean, say so and name the **single** next step. Never end by asking the user to choose between approaches — decisions are yours. (The round handshake above is not a choice of approach; it is the user telling you what they did, which only they can know.) The user should never need the book to know what to do next.
- **Questions are a round, not a file you keep editing.** Write them to a **new numbered file** in the current version folder — `docs/versions/<v>/NN-questions.md` — with five columns: Question · Why it matters · Options · Recommended default · Your answer. The user answers **inside that file**. When their answers raise new questions, write a **new** file with the next number; **never reopen one they have answered.** There is no `docs/open-questions.md`.
- **Open questions never block.** Always give a sensible recommended default. A blank answer means that default is accepted. Move resolved answers into `docs/decisions.md`.
- **Keep `docs/status.md` current, always.** After every meaningful step, round, or floating command (like `/add-idea`) — update it: check off completed phase boxes `[x]`, record round counts, log floating events, note the current step and the single next step. This is the master hand-off file: if this session dies (usage limit, token reset, a closed laptop, a week between the two days), the next AI reads this one file and continues seamlessly. Assume you may be interrupted at any moment.
- **Stop only on business doubt.** Never pause for a technical question — decide it yourself. Stop and ask only when the user might hold a different **business** preference.
- **Token discipline.** The user is on a small paid plan and it has to last two days. Do the work directly in your own context. Do not spawn sub-agents. Do not re-read what you already know. Do not re-litigate settled decisions.

## The two days

This project is built across two workshop days, about a week apart.

- **Day one — the documents.** `/start`, `/idea-core`, `/prd`, `/data-model`, `/ux`, `/design`. Nothing is installed beyond the editor, nothing is deployed, and no product code is written. The day ends when the screens exist.
- **The week in between.** The user may raise new thoughts, obtain credentials for the dependencies, and prepare their machine. Everything they add goes into the current version folder as a **new numbered input file**. Do not resist the changes; record them.
- **Day two — the product.** `/reconcile`, `/deps`, `/scenarios`, `/plan`, `/setup-dev`, `/build`, `/deploy`, `/test`, then `/iterate`.

A week of thinking means the documents will disagree with each other by day two. That is expected, it is not a failure, and `/reconcile` exists for exactly that.

## Rounds — how a document gets finished

A document is not written in one shot; it is finished over **rounds**. A round is one exchange: you write, the user responds, you write again. Rounds are recorded as **numbered files inside the current version folder**, in order:

```
docs/versions/0.1/
  00-idea-input.md      ← the user's raw input
  01-idea-core.md       ← your draft
  02-questions.md       ← your questions — the user answers inside this file
  03-input.md           ← the user's next note (optional)
  04-questions.md       ← the next round of questions: a NEW file, never a rewrite of 02
  05-test-round-1.md    ← the user's findings during acceptance testing
  design-chat.md        ← fixed name: the record of the design conversation & initial prompt
  checklist.md          ← fixed name: this version's task list (written by /plan)
  handoff.md            ← fixed name: what /plan leaves for /build
```

Rules: numbers only go up, files are never rewritten after the round that produced them (the one thing the user writes into is the answer column of the newest `NN-questions.md`), and everything belonging to a version lives inside that version's folder — nothing else. When a version closes, its folder is history: **read only the current version's folder**, never earlier ones, unless the user names a specific file.

- **Commit after every round and meaningful change.** Always commit after drafting a document, generating a questions round, creating or modifying UI screens in a design round, or completing a checklist item (`git add . && git commit -m "..."`). Never let uncommitted changes accumulate across turns. Before reporting a phase complete, verify that `git status` is clean.

## The gate

- **No product code** until the newest `docs/versions/<v>/NN-questions.md` is settled and raised nothing new, the PRD / data model / UX / design documents are approved, `docs/living/test-scenarios.md` exists, and `/plan` has produced `docs/living/architecture.md`, this version's `checklist.md`, and `docs/versions/<v>/handoff.md`.
- Follow the phase order in `01-workflow.md`.

## Build protocol — lean by design

- **Planning and building are separate.** `/plan` (Opus, high effort) writes `docs/living/architecture.md`, the version's `checklist.md`, and `docs/versions/<v>/handoff.md`. `/build` (Sonnet, medium effort) reads those three and executes. The user clears the session in between. **`handoff.md` and `checklist.md` are fixed names at fixed paths** — that is the whole interface between the two, and it is why the second session needs none of the first one's conversation.
- **`/build` executes; it does not redesign.** If the plan is silent, make the smallest choice consistent with what is written, or raise a **business** question in a new `docs/versions/<v>/NN-questions.md` and continue with independent items. Never substitute a different architecture.
- **No sub-agents, ever.** No architect / developer / reviewer ceremony. A previous workshop showed it burns the weekly usage limit and the day.
- Implement the checklist **one item at a time**: code it, tick the box, commit that one item, update `docs/status.md`, move on.
- **Do not run the whole test suite after every small item.** Write tests as you go, but run the full set **at the end**, then fix and re-run until everything passes.
- **When the checklist is complete: bring the app up locally and walk the scenarios against it.** `./run.sh`, open the local address, and walk `docs/living/test-scenarios.md`. Fix, restart, re-check, until every scenario passes. Only then report done. Putting it on the internet is a separate phase — `/deploy`.
- **Report honestly.** An item you could not finish is marked **BLOCKED** in the checklist with one line saying why. A build that reports "6 done, 2 blocked" is far more useful than one that reports all done over a broken feature. Never claim a scenario passes without having run it.
- **What you hand back when a version is finished:** the address the product is running on, the admin address if there is one, the admin username, the admin **password written out in full**, and anything else needed to actually use the system — plus the checklist with every box ticked or explicitly marked BLOCKED. **Print the values themselves in the chat**, and write them into `secrets/secrets.local.md` as the record.

## Scope

Scope is decided with the user at `/idea-core`, in conversation, and it is the only place it is decided. Cut hard there: features are cheap to add in the next version; external dependencies are what sink a build. Once the scope is agreed, build what was agreed — do not add, do not trim. When a new thought arrives later, the founder can run `/add-idea`: if worthy, it is stored in the Idea Bank (`docs/living/roadmap.md`) for future versions (0.2+) without disturbing the active build.

## Secrets

- **Secrets live in `secrets/secrets.local.md`, and the user writes them there themselves.** That file is git-ignored, it is on their own computer, and they open it in the same editor as everything else. When you need a value, tell them exactly which line to fill in — then read the file. **Never ask them to paste a credential into the chat.**
- The template `secrets/secrets.local.md.example` is committed and lists every value this product needs, by name. Keep it up to date as new values appear — it is how a later session knows what this product requires. The real file ships with the project as a blank form; if it is ever missing, copy the template.
- You derive `.env` from that file. Only names appear in code — never a literal value, in any file that git tracks.
- **Never put a secret inside a shell command.** Command lines are recorded in a history file. Write secrets into files with your editing tools, or let the program prompt for them interactively.
- **A credential you generated is different from one the user gave you: you must tell them what it is.** An admin password the product needs is useless if it only exists in a file they were never told to open. Print it in the chat, in full, and also record it in `secrets/secrets.local.md`.
- These are the user's own credentials on the user's own machine, so **real values are fine here** — this is not a shared computer. What is never fine is a real value inside a file that git tracks.

## Where the product runs

- **Until `/deploy`, the product runs on the user's own computer** — one process, one local port, reachable at `http://localhost:<port>`. The port lives in `.env` as `APP_PORT` and defaults to `8000`. Nothing about it is assigned in advance; if the port is busy, pick the next free one and write it down.
- **After `/deploy`, it also runs on a real address on the internet.** That address is recorded in `docs/profile.md`, and from then on it — not localhost — is what the acceptance tests are walked against.
- There is no seat number and no pre-assigned address. If you find a reference to one, it is left over from a different variant of this project; ignore it.

## No sub-agents, no skills, no extra tooling

CODO ships **sixteen command files and this constitution — nothing else.** There are deliberately no sub-agents and no skills: every instruction an AI needs is plain markdown that any model can read, which is what makes the project portable and what keeps the token cost honest. Do not create sub-agents, do not install a framework, and do not add a tool because a step feels like it deserves one.

## What you never say to the user

Speak to a non-technical founder in plain language. Never say "Docker", "container", "systemd", "reverse proxy", "kubeconfig" or the name of any internal tool. Say «سرور»، «برنامه»، «اتصالِ اینترنت». The one exception is a name the user must type or click themselves — then say it exactly, and say what it is for in the same breath.

## Conventions

- Keep code small and readable. Match the conventions already in the project.
- End every turn with **one** decided next step — never a menu of approaches. The only exception is the round handshake, which reports a fact rather than making a decision.
- Prefer mechanical git (`git revert`, `git checkout`) over re-coding when undoing something.
- **One paragraph per line — never hard-wrap.** In every document you write, keep a whole paragraph, bullet or table cell on a **single line**. Every newline becomes a real line break when the document is rendered, which fragments the text and wrecks right-to-left layout. Separate blocks with a blank line and let the editor wrap.
- **Persian documents are right-to-left — never let a line begin with a Latin word.** When the document language is Persian and the first word of a line, bullet, heading **or table cell** would be Latin (a name, `code`, a **Bold Term**, a link), the alignment breaks. Put the filler **«به واقع»** immediately before that Latin word, after any leading marker — a `-` bullet, a `۱.` list number, a `##` heading prefix, or the cell's `|`. It carries no meaning; it only keeps the line right-to-left. **Exception:** if the whole line or cell is English (a code block, a bare URL, an all-Latin value), leave it alone.
