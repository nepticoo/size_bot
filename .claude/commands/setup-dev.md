description: Prepare the user's computer for the build — install and verify exactly what the plan says this product needs

# /setup-dev — make this computer ready to build

This is the mechanical half of day two: no product judgement, no decisions, just installing what the plan already decided and proving it works.

**Do this in the free GitHub Copilot panel, not in Claude.** It is installation work, it needs nothing from the product conversation, and it costs nothing — which is the point, because the Claude quota has to last the whole day. If you are Claude and the user ran this here anyway, tell them once that Copilot can do it, then do it if they would rather stay.

## 1. Read what is actually needed

Read the **«چه چیزی باید نصب باشد»** section at the end of `docs/living/architecture.md`, plus `docs/constitution/02-tech-stack.md`. That is the whole requirement list. **Do not install anything that is not on it** and do not "while we are here" your way into a larger setup.

If `architecture.md` does not exist, stop: the plan has not run. Say so and tell the user to run `/plan` first.

## 2. Find out what is already there before installing anything

Most of this should already be installed — it is the baseline, and the user was asked to do it during the week. Check first, in one pass:

```
python --version   (or python3 --version)
node --version
npm --version
git --version
```

Report what you found in one short line each: present and the right major version, present but too old, or missing. Only then install what is genuinely absent.

## 3. Install what is missing

- **Python 3.12** and **Node 22 LTS** are the baseline. On Windows, use the official installers and make sure the "add to PATH" option is ticked — a tool that is installed but not on PATH produces the single most confusing error in this whole workshop.
- Anything else comes from the plan's list.
- **After every install, close and reopen VS Code**, then check the version again. A newly installed tool is invisible to an editor that was already running, and this one step prevents most of the "but I installed it" conversations.
- Do **not** install Docker, a database server, or any virtualisation. The product runs directly on this machine; none of that is needed here.

## 4. Prove it, do not assume it

The phase is not finished because things were installed. It is finished when they answer:

1. Every command in step 2 prints a version, in a **fresh** terminal.
2. `python -m venv` can create a virtual environment in a scratch folder.
3. `npm --version` works from inside the project folder.

If something still fails after a reopen, say exactly what failed and what you tried. Do not improvise a workaround that leaves the machine in a state nobody can reproduce — a clean reinstall with PATH ticked beats a clever fix.

## 5. Record it

Write a short note into `docs/status.md`: what was already present, what you installed, what version. When the build fails at midnight over a missing tool, this is the file that answers why. Commit.

**Next — you decide:** when everything answers, say so and tell the user to go back to the Claude panel and do the three steps `/plan` gave them: `/clear`, `/model` → Sonnet, `/effort` → medium, then `/build`.
